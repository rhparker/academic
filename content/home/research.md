## Stability of solitary waves 

Solitary waves are localized disturbances in a medium that maintain their shape as they propagate at a constant velocity. I study the existence and stability of multi-pulse solitary waves in Hamiltonian systems such as the fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV5) and the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLS). Multi-pulses are disturbances which resemble multiple, well separated copies of a single solitary wave. 

{{< figure src="img/eigpatterns.png" caption="Double pulses in KdV5 (left) and DNLS (center). Corresponding eigenvalue pattern on right." >}}

I am interested in how the geometry of a multi-pulse solution determines its spectral stability. My [research statement](files/researchstatement.pdf) summarizes the work I have done on multi-pulses.
