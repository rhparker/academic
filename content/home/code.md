## [AUTOdocker](https://github.com/rhparker/AUTOdocker)

[AUTO](https://github.com/auto-07p) is a publicly available software package used for continuation and bifurcation problems in ordinary differential equations and dynamical systems. It was written in 1980 and has been continually updated and maintained since then. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a platform that delivers OS-level virtualization via packages called containers. Running AUTO in a Docker container allows the software to be run in a standard environment which is consistent across all platforms. You no longer have to install AUTO on your system. Interfacing with AUTO can be done using both the command line and Jupyter notebooks. This package contains Jupyter notebooks for most of the AUTO demos. These notebooks interface with AUTO to run the relevant demos, as well as plot the resulting solutions and bifurcation diagrams.
